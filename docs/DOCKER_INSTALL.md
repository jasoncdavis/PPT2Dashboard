### Docker Installations:
Ensure you have docker and docker-compose installed in your environment.  In the project's [docker](./docker/) directory is the [docker-compose.yaml](./docker/docker-compose.yaml) file which defines the environment's service requirements.  Essentially, Apache, Python and MySQL images are created.  Remember your first time running 'docker-compose up' will require some time to download images from standard repositories.
For the docker image we will create two container volumes, web-data and mysql-data, which maintain the dynamic content for the Apache server and the MySQL database.  They will persist data if 'docker-compose stop' or 'docker-compose down' is executed.  Ensure you monitor the host system's file storage.  Development was done with about 20G disk space and easily manages thousands of endpoint monitors.  

Access the Python container from the host server running docker, with 'docker exec -it dd-cam_python_1 bash'.  The project files are in /project/code.
